# Random City Map Generator

This Java application generates a random map of 100 cities, each with random latitude and longitude coordinates, and establishes road connections between them. The map is visualized using the GraphStream library, with different types of roads distinguished by the number of lanes.

## Features

- **Random City Generation**: Generates 100 cities with unique names and random coordinates.
- **Road Connections**: Connects cities with roads of varying types:
  - 4 lanes: National Highways
  - 3 lanes: Inter-State Highways
  - 2 lanes: Highways
  - 1 lane: Main Roads
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualizes the cities as nodes and roads as edges using GraphStream, with visual differentiation based on road types.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or later
- GraphStream library
